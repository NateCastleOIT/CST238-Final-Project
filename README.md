# Grid Optimizer for Resource Gathering Games

## Overview

Grid Optimizer is a GUI program designed to optimize resource gathering in grid-based games. The program allows users to either load a map file from a game or manually input the grid layout. The application then generates an optimized position for in-game builds to maximize resource production.

## Features

- **Game Selection:** Choose the game for which you want to optimize resource gathering.
- **Data Source Selection:** Load game data from a file or manually input the grid layout.
- **Grid Layout:** Manually fill out the grid with a list of tiles accurate to the chosen game.
- **Optimization Output:** Generate an optimized position for in-game builds to produce the most amount of resources.

## Usage

1. **Game Selection:** Start by selecting the game you want to optimize from the list on the main page.
2. **Data Source Selection:** Choose whether you want to load game data from a file or manually input the grid layout.
3. **Grid Layout:** If you chose to manually input the grid layout, select the tiles from the list and click on the grid to change the cells to the currently selected tile.
4. **Optimization Output:** Once you've filled out the grid to your desired input, press the "Generate" button. A new window will pop up with the optimized position for in-game builds to produce the most amount of resources.

## Testing

The program has been thoroughly tested to ensure that all features work as expected. This includes testing the basic functions of the program, such as loading from a file and editing the map, as well as edge case testing. Future testing plans include having peers test the program and provide feedback.

## Feedback

User feedback is highly valued and used to improve the program. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please feel free to share them.

## Constraints

The program is designed to provide optimization for a very narrow kind of game, for specific types of resources. As such, it is constrained to work with the rules of such games. This is ONLY for optimizing the resources provided; nothing else.

## Future Work

Future work on the program will focus on improving the user interface and adding support for more games. Feedback from users will be used to identify areas for improvement and new features to add.
